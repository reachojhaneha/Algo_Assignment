To build the code just run `make`. This will generate the tile binary.

USAGE:
./tile [k] 

- k has to be greater than 2. I've tested k till 512 on my machine beyond which it gives 'inf' as output. Passing k is optional. If no argument is passed the program sets k as 3 by default.

OUTPUT:
It prints the number of squares covered (and percentage area) by each tile A, B, C and D.
